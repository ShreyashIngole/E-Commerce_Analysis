# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

This project analyzes a real-world Brazilian e-commerce dataset from the Olist marketplace to perform **customer segmentation** using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis. The goal is to identify key customer groups such as loyal customers, big spenders, and at-risk customers to help drive targeted marketing and retention strategies.

## Whatâ€™s inside:

- Data cleaning and merging of multiple datasets including orders, products, customers, and reviews
- Calculation of RFM metrics to evaluate customer purchase behavior
- Segmentation of customers into meaningful groups based on their purchasing patterns
- Robust handling of edge cases in scoring to ensure accurate segmentation
- Clear, reproducible Python code designed to run smoothly in Google Colab
- Ready for extension with visualization, predictive modeling, or recommendation systems

## Dataset

The project uses the publicly available [Olist E-commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce), which contains detailed transactional and product information from a multi-vendor online marketplace.
